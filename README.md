# geo_fish

iOS/Android flutter app (in progress)

The goal is to create an app where users will have possibility to track their catches by adding fishes to the database. Fish item will include photo, location and wheather conditions. Users will have a choice between sharing fish data between all users or  add it only to the private catalog. Pottentialy I would like to develop this app much further, by adding charts with statistics, filtering or even social media app facilities.
