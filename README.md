iOS/Android flutter app

Some time ago I  have found out how flutter is powerfull and I decided to learn dart and this awesome framework.  I would like to solve real problem, which I'm facing as a angler. The goal is to create an app where users will have possibility to track their catches by adding fishes to the database. Fish item will include photo, location and wheather conditions. Users will have a choice between sharing fish data between all users or  add it only to the private catalog. Pottentialy I would like to develop this app much further, by adding charts with statistics, filtering or even social media app facilities.
